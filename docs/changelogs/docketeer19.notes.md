# Changelog

## v19.0.0
#### Features
 


### Bug Fixes


### TypeScript Refinement
- **Enhanced Type Strictness:** Significantly reduced the use of 'any' types across the frontend codebase, both implicit and explicit, enhancing type safety.
- **Type Import Issues:** Addressed problems related to how types were imported between `ui-types.d.ts` and `types.d.ts`. Discovered that some interfaces defined in `ui-types.d.ts` were not properly imported into `types.d.ts`, causing some properties to default to 'any'.
- **Configuration Adjustment:** Despite setting `noImplicitAny` to true in `tsconfig.json`, some TypeScript issues remain obscured.
- **Action for Future Teams:**
  - **Type Verification:** Future teams should manually verify type assignments by hovering over types in the IDE to ensure accuracy.
  - **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continue to monitor and refine type usage and import practices to close gaps in type safety.
